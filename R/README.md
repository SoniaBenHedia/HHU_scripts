# R

In this folder you find all scripts and the processed data to run the scripts which were used to analyze the data analyzed in my
PhD-dissertation. Part of the data was extracted from the Switchboard Corpus (Godfrey, J. J. and Holliman, E. (1997). Switchboard-1 release 2.)(Corpus Study), the other was collected by conducting speech production experiments in Cambridge, UK, in 2015/2016 (Experimental Study). For the data and analyses of each study, I created a subfolder. Please refer to the ReadMe-files in the pertinent folders.

The folders are:

**1. Corpus** 

**2. Experiment**
