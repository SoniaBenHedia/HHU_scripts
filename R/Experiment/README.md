# Experiment

In this folder you find all scripts and the processed data to run the scripts which were used to analyze the experimental data analyzed in my
PhD-dissertation. The data was collected at Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK, in 2015 and 2016.

This folder has three subfolders:

**1. Decomposibility:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the decomposibility information about the affixes words in the study.
><p>Furthermore, the folder contains the script with the decomposability analyses [combining data frames, analyzing relations between variables using correlation testing, analyzing distributions, cluster analyses].

**2. Duration:** 
><p>This folder contains six subfolders. Each subfolder contains the data set and scripts for the analyses of one of the investigated affixes. As I also conducted one analyses in which un- and in- were analyzed in one model, there is also a subfolder for this data set/ analysis.

><p> 2.1. dis
><p> 2.2. im
><p> 2.3. in
><p> 2.4. ly
><p> 2.5. un
><p> 2.6. un and in
  
><p> Please refer to the read me files in the pertinent subfolders for more information.

**3. Ratings:** 
><p> In this folder you find rating data I collected for my PhD-thesis, as well as the analyses I conducted to ensure the validity and reliability of the rating. In the analyses, I cleaned and recoded the dataframe and checked for the validity of the rating by looking at distributions and checking various interrater-reliability measures (Chronbach's alpha, item-total correlations, ICCs)
