# Experiment

In this folder you find all scripts and the processed data to run the scripts which were used to analyze the experimental data analyzed in my
PhD-dissertation. The data was collected at Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK, in 2015 and 2016.

This folder has three subfolders:

**Decomposibility:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the decomposibility information about the affixes words in the study.
><p>Furthermore, the folder contains the script with the decomposability analyses [combining data frames, analyzing relations between variables using correlation testing, analyzing distributions, cluster analyses].

**Duration:** 
><p>This folder contains six subfolders. Each subfolder contains the data set and scripts for the analyses of one of the investigated affixes. As I also conducted one analyses in which un- and in- were analyzed in one model, there is also a subfolder for this data set/ analysis.

><p> Please refer to the read me files in the pertinent subfolders for more information.
  
**dis:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the information about the dis-affixed words in the study.
><p> Furthermore, the folder contains three scripts in which the durations of the boundary-adjacent segment are analyzed.
><p>In the script 'Dis_Complex_AbsDur_2016_12-09.R', the absolute duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'Dis_Complex_RelDur_2016_12-02.R', the relative duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'transparency_dis_corpus_2016_12-30_individual_factors and pcp.R', the relation between different decomposability variables for the dis-data set are tested (correlations/distributions/c-tree). Furthermore, the effect of decomposability on duration is tested using linear regression models.


**im:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the information about the im-affixed words in the study.
><p> Furthermore, the folder contains two scripts in which the durations of the boundary-adjacent segment are analyzed. 
><p>In the script 'M4_ImComplexAbs-2016-11-16.R', the absolute duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'M4_ImComplexRel-2016-11-21.R', the relative duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.


**ly:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the information about the ly-affixed words in the study.
><p> Furthermore, the folder contains two scripts in which the durations of the boundary-adjacent segment are analyzed.
><p>In the script 'LyComplex-2016_12-31_AbsDur.R', the absolute duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'LyComplex-2016_12-31_RelDur.R', the relative duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.

**un:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the information about the un-affixed words in the study.
><p> Furthermore, the folder contains two scripts in which the durations of the boundary-adjacent segment are analyzed.
><p>In the script 'M2_UnComplexAbs-2016-11-12.R', the absolute duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'M2_UnComplexRel-2016-11-18.R', the relative duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.

**Ratings:** 
><p> In this folder you find rating data I collected for my PhD-thesis, as well as the analyses I conducted to ensure the validity and reliability of the rating. In the analyses, I cleaned and recoded the dataframe and checked for the validity of the rating by looking at distributions and checking various interrater-reliability measures (Chronbach's alpha, item-total correlations, ICCs)
