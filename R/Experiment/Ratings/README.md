## Ratings

<p> In this folder you find rating data I collected for my PhD-thesis, as well as the analyses I conducted to ensure the validity and reliability of the rating. In the analyses, I cleaned and recoded the dataframe and checked for the validity of the rating by looking at distributions and checking various interrater-reliability measures (Chronbach's alpha, item-total correlations, ICCs)
