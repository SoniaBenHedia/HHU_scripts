# Corpus

In this folder you find all scripts and the processed data to run the scripts which were used to analyze the corpus data analyzed in 
PhD-dissertaion. The data was extracted from the Switchboard Corpus (Godfrey, J. J. and Holliman, E. (1997). Switchboard-1 release 2.).

This folder has five subfolders:

**Decomposibility:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the decomposibility information about the affixes words in the study.
><p>Furthermore, the folder contains the script with the decomposability analyses [combining data frames, analyzing relations between variables using correlation testing, analyzing distributions, linear models, conditional inference trees, principal component analyses, multimodel-inferencing].


**dis:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the information about the dis-affixed words in the study.
><p> Furthermore, the folder contains three scripts in which the durations of the boundary-adjacent segment are analyzed.
><p>In the script 'Dis_Complex_AbsDur_2016_12-09.R', the absolute duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'Dis_Complex_RelDur_2016_12-02.R', the relative duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'transparency_dis_corpus_2016_12-30_individual_factors and pcp.R', the relation between different decomposability variables for the dis-data set are tested (correlations/distributions/c-tree). Furthermore, the effect of decomposability on duration is tested using linear regression models.


**im:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the information about the im-affixed words in the study.
><p> Furthermore, the folder contains two scripts in which the durations of the boundary-adjacent segment are analyzed. 
><p>In the script 'M4_ImComplexAbs-2016-11-16.R', the absolute duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'M4_ImComplexRel-2016-11-21.R', the relative duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.


**ly:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the information about the ly-affixed words in the study.
><p> Furthermore, the folder contains two scripts in which the durations of the boundary-adjacent segment are analyzed.
><p>In the script 'LyComplex-2016_12-31_AbsDur.R', the absolute duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'LyComplex-2016_12-31_RelDur.R', the relative duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.

**un:** 
><p> Here you find csv-files containing the information about the un-affixed words in the study.
><p> Furthermore, the folder contains two scripts in which the durations of the boundary-adjacent segment are analyzed.
><p>In the script 'M2_UnComplexAbs-2016-11-12.R', the absolute duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'M2_UnComplexRel-2016-11-18.R', the relative duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
