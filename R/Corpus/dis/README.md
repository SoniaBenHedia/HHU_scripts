## dis ##

><p> Here you find csv-files containing the information about the dis-affixed words in the study.
><p> Furthermore, the folder contains three scripts in which the durations of the boundary-adjacent segment are analyzed.
><p>In the script 'Dis_Complex_AbsDur_2016_12-09.R', the absolute duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'Dis_Complex_RelDur_2016_12-02.R', the relative duration is analzyed by means of linear regression models.
><p> In the script 'transparency_dis_corpus_2016_12-30_individual_factors and pcp.R', the relation between different decomposability variables for the dis-data set are tested (correlations/distributions/c-tree). Furthermore, the effect of decomposability on duration is tested using linear regression models.
