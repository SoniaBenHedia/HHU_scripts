# HHU_scripts

This folder entails scripts I wrote and used during my time at the Heinrich-Heine-University,DÃ¼sseldorf, while working in der DFG funded research unit 'Spoken Morphology' (FOR2373). 

There are four folders

#1. Python:  I wrote all of the scripts found in this folder. There are two subfoldes: 'PhD' and 'Other':

>>**  1.1. PhD:** In this folder you find the scripts I wrote for my PhD project. These scripts read out .TextGrid-files, re-organize tables, sort,       create and alter files. Most of these scripts are non-modular. I am currently working on modular, beautified versions of the scripts.
  
**  1.2 Other:** These scripts I wrote when learning and expansing my Python skills. They write several fuctions, such as as frequency     measurement functions, a function which identifes e-mail adreeses, a dictionary or a 'text-cleaner'.

**2. R:**


3. Praat

4. Documentation
