# HHU_scripts

This folder entails scripts I wrote and used during my time at the Heinrich-Heine-University,DÃ¼sseldorf, while working in der DFG funded research unit 'Spoken Morphology' (FOR2373). 

There are four folders

**1. R:**
In this folder you find all scripts and the processed data to run the scripts which were used to analyze the data analyzed in my
PhD-dissertation. Part of the data was extracted from the Switchboard Corpus (Godfrey, J. J. and Holliman, E. (1997). Switchboard-1 release 2.)(Corpus Study), the other was collected by conducting speech production experiments in Cambridge, UK, in 2015/2016 (Experimental Study). For the data and analyses of each study, I created a subfolder. The folders are:

>**1.1. Corpus** 

>**1.2. Experiment** 

Please refer to the ReadMe-files in the pertinent folders for more information.

**2. Python:**  I wrote all of the scripts found in this folder. There are two subfoldes: 'PhD' and 'Other':

>**2.1. PhD:** In this folder you find the scripts I wrote for my PhD project. These scripts read out .TextGrid-files, re-organize tables, sort,create and alter files. Most of these scripts are non-modular. I am currently working on modular, beautified versions of the scripts.
  
>**2.2. Other:** These scripts I wrote when learning and expansing my Python skills. They write several fuctions, such as as frequency     measurement functions, a function which identifes e-mail adreeses, or a dictionary.
