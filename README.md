# HHU_scripts

This folder entails scripts I wrote and used during my time at the Heinrich-Heine-University,DÃ¼sseldorf, while working in der DFG funded research unit 'Spoken Morphology' (FOR2373). 

There are four folders

**1. R:**

In this folder you find all scripts I wrote and used to analyze the data analyzed in my
PhD-dissertation. You also find the pertinent data. For the data and analyses of each study, I created a subfolder. The two main sub folders, one for the corpus study of my PhD-project, one for the experimental study of my PhD project:

>**1.1. Corpus:**  In this subfolder you find the scripts and the data which was extracted from the Switchboard Corpus (Godfrey, J. J. and Holliman, E. (1997). Switchboard-1 release 2.).

>**1.2. Experiment:** In this subfolder you find the scripts and the data which was collected by conducting speech production experiments in Cambridge, UK, in 2015/2016.

Please refer to the ReadMe-files in the pertinent folders for more information.

**2. Python:**

I wrote all of the scripts found in this folder. There are two subfoldes: 'PhD' and 'Other':

>**2.1. PhD:** In this folder you find the scripts I wrote for my PhD project. These scripts read out .TextGrid-files, re-organize tables, sort,create and alter files. Most of these scripts are non-modular. I am currently working on modular, beautified versions of the scripts.
  
>**2.2. Other:** These scripts I wrote when learning and expansing my Python skills. They write several fuctions, such as as frequency     measurement functions, a function which identifes e-mail adreeses, or a dictionary.


**3. Praat**

Here you can find some useful scripts I used to pre-process some of my  audio data. I have not written these scripts (authors are named in the scripts!).

**4. Documentation/Guidelines**
  
Here you can find 

><p> A document in which I formulated the annotation/segmentation guidelines for the phonetic segmentation of the sound files. These guidelines do not only describe the segmentation criteria but also document our work process.
**Note:** The guidelines are in German and English right now, and I am working on a more coherent version.
  
><p> A document in which I documented the work flow of the processing of the recorded sound files from my speech production experiments, i.e. which scripts were used when, which steps were taken in which order.
