In this folder you find the scripts I wrote for my PhD project. These scripts read out .TextGrid-files, re-organize tables, sort, create and alter files. Most of these scripts are non-modular. I am currently working on modular, beautified versions of the scripts.

This is a list of files in this folder:

1. Cam_textgrids_auslesenWithConsonant.py:		This script is supposed to read textgrids and get information out of it

2. CamExp_measure_dur_4.py: 		This script is supposed to read textgrids and get information out of it (different info that in 1))

# 3. checking_items.py:            
This program extracts 10 % of thhe items in each folder of the fertige textgride of the same date and saves them in a new folder (Checking Items). It randomly selects 10 textgriuds and teh matching sound files from each folder (containing 100 items).

4. copy_and_sort_sound_files_make_textgrids.py

5. exp_part1_fillers_same_names_01-10-2015.py

6. presentation_maker_2_versions_reading_exp_Cambridge_2016.py

7. read_compound_gem_dur3_n.py

8. transform_ratings_tables_in_un.py
