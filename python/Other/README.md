## Other

These scripts I wrote when learning and expanding my Python skills. They write several fuctions, such as as frequency measurement functions, a function which identifes e-mail adreeses, a dictionary or a 'text-cleaner'.

This is a list of files in this folder:


**1. adress.py:** <p>This script contains a function checking whether a string is a valid e-mail address.

**2. bigram.py:** <p>This script contains a function that returns a list of bigrams (2 graphemes) of a string.

**3. count.py:**    <p>This script contains two simple functions counting the type and token number of a given text (.txt-file). Note: No data cleaning and pre-processing.

**4. dict.py:**<p>This script contains a small function which translates words from German to English and vice versa given a small dictionary which is also built in the script.

**5.dict_3_lang.py:** <p>This script contains a function which translates words from German to English and French and and vice versa, as well as from French to English and vice versa. It is given a small dictionary which is also built in the script.

**6. freq.py:** <p>This script contains a function returns two dictionaries from a file. The first dictionary is lex in which each word is a key, and its frequency is the value. The second dictionary has the frequencies as its keys and a list of words with the pertinent frequencues as its values

**7.latein_deklinieren_ben_hedia.py.py:**<p>This script contains a function which declines Latin words ending on -o or -i.

**8. punkte.py:** <p>This script computes the mean points students got in a test bases on a list given in a txt-file.

**9. transform_ratings_tables_in_un.py:** <p>This script contains a function computing the area of a rectangle.

**10.sonia.py:**<p>This script contains functions which identify the X shortest and X longest words (types) in a given text.

**11. spiel.py:** <p>This script contains the code for a guessing game in which you have to guess a random number.

**12. Ãœbung.py:** <p>This script contains a function which lets you know how many keys you supposedly pressed with the left hand, and how many you supposedly pressed with the right hand when typing a text.
