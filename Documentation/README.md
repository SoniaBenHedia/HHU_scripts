# Documentation
  
Here you can find 

1. A document in which I formulated the annotation/segmentation guidelines for the phonetic segmentation of the sound files. These guidelines do not only describe the segmentation criteria but also document our work process.
**Note:** The guidelines are in German and English right now, and I am working on a more coherent version.
  
2. A document in which I documented the work flow of the processing of the recorded sound files from my speech production experiments, i.e. which scripts were used when, which steps were taken in which order.
